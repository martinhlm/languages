> Continuous Tenses
English has two present tenses: simple ("I write") and continuous ("I am writing"),
but French has no specialized continuous verb tenses.
This means that "I write", "I am writing", and "I do write" can translate to
j'écris (not je suis écris) and vice versa.

However, the idiomatic phrase « être en train de » is often used to indicate
that someone is in the process of doing something.

    Je suis en train de manger. — I am [in the process of] eating.
    When translating, remember that English stative verbs have no continuous forms.
    For instance, « j'aime un garçon » cannot be translated as "I am loving a boy".


> The partitive article
The partitive article is used for unspecified amounts of uncountable nouns.
In English, it can translate to "some", but it's often just omitted.
Remember that du is a contraction of de + le and that partitives can elide.

Gender	     Partitive Article	      Example
Masculine	      du	         Je mange du poisson. — I am eating fish.
Feminine	      de la	         Je mange de la viande. — I am eating meat.
Elided Masc.      de l'	         Je mange de l'ananas. — I am eating pineapple.
Elided Fem.	      de l'	         Je bois de l'eau. — I am drinking water.


> Count Noun, Mass Noun, or Both?
Count nouns are discrete and can be counted, like un livre ("a book").
They can be modified by definite and indefinite articles, but not partitive articles.

Je lis un livre.            — I am reading a book.
Nous avons les livres.      — We have the books.
Mass nouns like lait ("milk") are uncountable, and they can be modified
by definite and partitive articles, but not indefinite articles.

Je bois du lait. — I am drinking [some] milk.
Je bois le lait. — I am drinking the milk.
However, many nouns can behave as both count nouns and mass nouns.
This is true for most edible things. For instance, consider poisson ("fish") or vin ("wine"):

Count noun: Le poisson est rouge. — The fish is red.
Mass noun: Je mange du poisson. — I eat [some] fish.
Count noun: Le vin est blanc. — The wine is white.
Mass noun: Je bois du vin rouge ou blanc. — I drink red or white wine.


> De + Definite Article
De plus a definite article can also have other meanings. De means "of" or "from",
so this can also indicate possession or association with a definite noun.

La copie du livre.      — The copy of the book.
Les copies des livres.  — The copies of the books.
L'enfant de la femme.   — The woman's child.
