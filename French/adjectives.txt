> Agreement
    French adjectives must agree in number and gender with the nouns that they
    modify.
        A black dog         "un chien noir"
        A black dress       "une robe noire"

    When used with pronouns, adjectives agree with the noun that has been replaced


> Adjective placement
    In French, most adjectives appear after the nouns they modify.
    For instance, le chat noir. However, some adjectives precede the noun.
    You can remember these types of nouns using the mnemonic BANGS.

        B is for beauty. Une belle femme — A beautiful woman

        A is for age. Une jeune fille — A young girl

        N is for number. Deux hommes — Two men
            This can also be for rank: Le premier mot — The first word

        G is for good or bad. Un bon garçon — A good boy

        S is for size. Un gros chat — A fat cat

All determiner adjectives (e.g. possessives, interrogatives, and demonstratives)
appear before the noun, e.g. mon livre ("my book") and ce cochon ("that pig").
You will learn these later.


> Figurative adjectives

    A few adjectives can come both before and after the noun depending on their
    meaning. The most common example is grand, which is a BANGS adjective for
    everything but people. For people, it comes before a noun when it means
    "important" and after the noun when it means "tall". For instance, Napoleon
    was un grand homme ("a great man"), but not un homme grand ("a tall man").

    Usually, figurative meanings will precede the noun, while literal meanings
    will follow the noun.

        un pauvre homme — a pitiful man
        un homme pauvre — a poor man
        un certain nombre — a certain (particular) number
        une victoire certaine — a certain (guaranteed) victory
        ma propre voiture — my own car
        ma voiture propre — my clean car
        un cher ami — a dear friend
        une montre chère — an expensive watch


> Euphony

    As you have already learned, elisions, contractions, liaisons, and
    enchaînements are all designed to prevent consecutive vowel sounds (which
    is called hiatus). This quest for harmonious sounds is called euphony and
    is an essential feature of French. It has, however, created some unexpected
    rules.

    For instance, the masculine beau ("beautiful") changes to bel if its noun
    begins with a vowel sound. A beautiful man is un bel homme. The other two
    common changes are vieux to vieil ("old") and nouveau to nouvel ("new").

    Note that this doesn't occur to feminine adjectives because they usually
    end in silent vowels.
