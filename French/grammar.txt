Grammar

> Continuous Tenses
    English has two present tenses: simple ("I write") and continuous ("I am writing"),
    but French has no specialized continuous verb tenses.
    This means that "I write", "I am writing", and "I do write" can translate to
    j'écris (not je suis écris) and vice versa.

    However, the idiomatic phrase « être en train de » is often used to indicate
    that someone is in the process of doing something.

        Je suis en train de manger. — I am [in the process of] eating.
        When translating, remember that English stative verbs have no continuous forms.
        For instance, « j'aime un garçon » cannot be translated as "I am loving a boy".


> The partitive article
    The partitive article is used for unspecified amounts of uncountable nouns.
    In English, it can translate to "some", but it's often just omitted.
    Remember that du is a contraction of de + le and that partitives can elide.

    Gender	     Partitive Article	      Example
    Masculine	      du	         Je mange du poisson. — I am eating fish.
    Feminine	      de la	         Je mange de la viande. — I am eating meat.
    Elided Masc.      de l'	         Je mange de l'ananas. — I am eating pineapple.
    Elided Fem.	      de l'	         Je bois de l'eau. — I am drinking water.


> Count Noun, Mass Noun, or Both?
    Count nouns are discrete and can be counted, like un livre ("a book").
    They can be modified by definite and indefinite articles, but not partitive articles.

    Je lis un livre.            — I am reading a book.
    Nous avons les livres.      — We have the books.
    Mass nouns like lait ("milk") are uncountable, and they can be modified
    by definite and partitive articles, but not indefinite articles.

    Je bois du lait. — I am drinking [some] milk.
    Je bois le lait. — I am drinking the milk.
    However, many nouns can behave as both count nouns and mass nouns.
    This is true for most edible things. For instance, consider poisson ("fish") or vin ("wine"):

    Count noun: Le poisson est rouge. — The fish is red.
    Mass noun: Je mange du poisson. — I eat [some] fish.
    Count noun: Le vin est blanc. — The wine is white.
    Mass noun: Je bois du vin rouge ou blanc. — I drink red or white wine.


> De + Definite Article
    De plus a definite article can also have other meanings. De means "of" or "from",
    so this can also indicate possession or association with a definite noun.

    La copie du livre.      — The copy of the book.
    Les copies des livres.  — The copies of the books.
    L'enfant de la femme.   — The woman's child.


> Diacritics
    The acute accent (é) only appears on E and produces a pure [e] that isn't
    found in English. To make this sound, say the word "cliché", but hold your
    tongue perfectly still on the last vowel to avoid making a diphthong sound.

    The grave accent (è) can appear on A/E/U, though it only changes the sound
    for E (to [ɛ], which is the E in "lemon"). Otherwise, it distinguishes
    homophones like a (a conjugated form of avoir) and à (a preposition).

    The cedilla (ç) softens a normally hard C sound to the soft C in "cent".
    Otherwise, a C followed by an A, O, or U has a hard sound like the C in "car".

    The circumflex (ê) usually means that an S used to follow the vowel in Old
    French or Latin. (The same is true of the acute accent.) For instance, île
    was once "isle".

    The trema (ë) indicates that two adjacent vowels must be pronounced separately,
    like in Noël ("Christmas") and maïs ("corn").


> Nasal Vowels
    There are four nasal vowels in French. Try to learn these sounds by listening
    to native speakers.

        IPA	    Letter Sequence	        Examples
        /œ̃/	  un/um	               un/parfum
        /ɛ̃/	  in/im/yn/ym	       vin/pain/syndicat/sympa
        /ɑ̃/	  an/am/en/em	       dans/chambre/en/emploi
        /ɔ̃/	  on/om	               mon/ombre

    These aren't always nasalized. If there's a double M or N, or if they are
    followed by any vowel, then the vowel should have an oral sound instead.
    For instance, un is nasal, but une is not. Also, vin is nasal, but vinaigre is not.
