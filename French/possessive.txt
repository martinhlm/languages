> Possessives Match What is Owned

    In English, possessive adjectives (e.g. "his") match the owner. However,
    in French, they match the thing being owned.

    Consider the example of "her lion". The French translation is son lion,
    because lion is masculine and both the lion and the woman are singular.
    Note that if we hear just son lion, we can't tell if the lion is owned by
    a man or woman. It's ambiguous without more context. If two people own a
    lion, then it is leur lion.

    Possessives have different forms that agree with four things: the number
    of owners, the number of things owned, the gender of the thing owned, and
    the grammatical person of the owner (e.g. "his" versus "my").

    The plural second-person possessive adjectives, votre and vos, should be
    used when addressing someone formally with vous.


> Euphony in Possessives

    For the sake of euphony, all singular feminine possessives switch to their
    masculine forms when followed by a vowel sound.

        Person	 Masculine	      Feminine	       Feminine + Vowel Sound
        1st	      mon chat	       ma robe	            mon eau
        2nd	      ton chat	       ta robe	            ton eau
        3rd	      son chat	       sa robe	            son eau


> Femme and Fille

    Femme can mean "woman" or "wife" and fille can mean "girl" or "daughter"
    depending on the context. For example, when femme and fille are preceded
    by a possessive adjective, then they translate to "wife" and "daughter",
    respectively.

        Une fille et une femme sont dans le restaurant 
            — A girl and a woman are in the restaurant.
            (Not: "A daughter and a wife are in the restaurant.")

        Ma fille — My daughter. (Not: "My girl".)

        Ta femme — Your wife. (Not: "Your woman".)
